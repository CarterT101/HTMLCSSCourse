	<h1> AMD, "Advanced Micro Devices" </h1>
		<main> Advanced Micro Devices, also known as "AMD," is an American company that developers computer processors and other related technologies </main>
	<h3> Why are they special? </h3>
		<p> Recently, they have become increasingly advanced in their efficiency and ability to create highly advanced central processing units and graphics processing units, catching up to their competition </p>
	<h6> They are important </h6>
		<p> While they have made technology revolutions in the past, most recently coming from a seemingly falling company compared to their competitors, Intel and NVIDIA, they have come back to nearly passing them in both CPUs, and GPUs, to the point where even Intel is now struggling to catch up. </p>
