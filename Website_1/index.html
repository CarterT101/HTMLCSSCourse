			<h3 id="shiba"> What is a Shiba? </h3>
				<p> The Shiba Inu breed was originally bred to be a hunting dog. It is small, alert, agile, and has a lot of stamina. 
				It is a Japanese dog, and it looks like a smaller version of the "Akita Inu," another Japanese dog. It has a fox-like face and has a soft and thick undercoat. 
				Their tails curl at the end, and when lying down their tails can shield their face and nose to protein them from the cold. </p>
