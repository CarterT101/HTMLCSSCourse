	<!-- What is a Shiba -->
		<div>
			<p> The Shiba Inu breed was originally bred to be a hunting dog. It is small, alert, agile, and has a lot of stamina. 
			It is a Japanese dog, and it looks like a smaller version of the "Akita Inu," another Japanese dog. It has a fox-like face and has a soft and thick undercoat. 
			Their tails curl at the end, and when lying down their tails can shield their face and nose to protein them from the cold.
